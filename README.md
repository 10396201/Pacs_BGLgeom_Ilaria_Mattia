Libgeograph

Graphs are often used in contexts which involve geometrical properties. This is a library that extends the Boost Graph Library (BGL) providing classes and functionalities to deal with the geometric properties of a graph, such as the geometrical description of the edges, coordinates of vertices, intersections between edges and boundary conditions in order to rapresent and solve on the graph PDE problems.
