\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Template class to handle disjoint sets  The template parameters are:\par
 Label\_\-map\_\-t: the type of a std::map which key is a vertex descriptor and the value is an unsigned int which has the meaning of the current label of the component to which that vertex belongs to.\par
 Components\_\-map\_\-t: the type of a std::map which key is an unsigned int used as label for the group and the value is a std::set containing all the vertex descriptor of the vertices that have that label, i.e that belong to the same component. \item\end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
