\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
struct \hyperlink{structno__topological__data}{no\_\-topological\_\-data}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em An empty struct to handle the case the user do not need to store topological data  Inside this the user may put data as vertex and edge descriptor for the connettivity of the graph. \item\end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classnew__reader__class}{new\_\-reader\_\-class$<$ Source\_\-data\_\-structure, Target\_\-data\_\-structure, Edge\_\-data\_\-structure, Topological\_\-data\_\-structure $>$}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Abstract class that implements the functionality to read a file and get data from it  The users has to specify, in the derived class, all variables he need in order to store information read from the input file. Then, through the definition of Edge\_\-data\_\-structure and Vertex\_\-data\_\-structure, he can get separately all the information to put on edges and vertices. \item\end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
